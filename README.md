## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Ensure you have Node.js installed. This installs the packages listed in `package.json` if available.

2. **Start Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command usually starts a local development server for interactive development.

3. **Build for Production**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This step generates optimized assets ready for deployment.
